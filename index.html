              Understanding AI’s Impact on Jobs and Businesses
            </h3>

            <p className="text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed text-sm">
              Something that has been at the forefront of everyone’s mind is artificial intelligence.
              Specifically, many people wonder what it means for the future of the job market and for businesses,
              both small and large. The ramifications that AI has for each of these areas are wide-reaching,
              and the collision between technology and the business industry will result in these topics being
              irrevocably changed.
            </p>

            <p className="text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed text-sm mt-3">
              Starting with the future of the job market, a major question is to what extent AI will replace
              jobs. I believe there are four major changes that will result from the development and continued
              implementation of AI. One of the most significant initial changes is that repetitive and predictable
              tasks will begin to be phased out...
            </p>

            {/* FULL UNCONDENSED BLOG POST 1 CONTINUES BELOW */}

            <p className="text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed text-sm mt-3">
              One of AI’s strengths is its ability to process and digest large amounts of data at once and produce
              accurate, personalized results based on prompts. These capabilities often exceed those of humans.
              As a result, jobs such as manual data entry, bookkeeping, and translation may be slowly phased out.
            </p>

            <p className="text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed text-sm mt-3">
              As these changes occur, the bar for baseline skills is likely to rise, which may negatively impact
              individuals who currently work in these roles. In response, many universities and certification
              programs will likely offer skills and specializations in roles that AI cannot easily replace, such as
              healthcare. However, job loss is not the only consequence of AI’s introduction into the workplace.
              These disruptions will also create new opportunities and positions.
            </p>

            <p className="text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed text-sm mt-3">
              Roles involving AI prompting and engineering are likely to become increasingly in demand. Being able
              to understand how to communicate effectively with AI systems in order to generate high-quality results
              will help individuals remain competitive in the job market. Additionally, roles that focus on the
              broader fallout and ethical ramifications of AI, such as AI lawyers and auditors, will become more
              common...
            </p>

            <p className="text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed text-sm mt-3">
              AI also has a significant impact on businesses, both large and small. In this context, AI integration
              refers to businesses adopting automation software, analytics systems, machine learning, and generative
              AI to increase efficiency and reduce costs. For small businesses, which often lack significant capital
              or resources, AI can be extremely valuable...
            </p>

            <p className="text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed text-sm mt-3">
              However, deep AI integration comes with risks. Small businesses often lack the technical expertise
              or personnel required to maintain and properly utilize AI systems. Financial limitations and labor
              shortages can also slow adoption. For large businesses, one of the greatest benefits of AI integration
              is cost savings. Automating large workflows and analyzing massive datasets allows companies to reallocate
              labor and financial resources to other areas...
            </p>

            <p className="text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed text-sm mt-3">
              Ultimately, the rise of AI presents both opportunities and challenges, and the ability to adapt
              responsibly will determine whether it strengthens or destabilizes the future of work and business.

              Finding My Place at the Intersection of Business & Technology
            </h3>

            <p className="text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed text-sm">
              Growing up, I was surrounded by STEM. Both of my parents work in technical fields, and technology
              was always part of my everyday life. Because of this, I was exposed to engineering concepts and
              scientific thinking from a young age. Even so, I eventually realized that my strengths and interests
              were more aligned with writing, communication, and understanding how people and organizations work...
            </p>

            {/* FULL BLOG POST 2 CONTINUES */}

            <p className="text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed text-sm mt-3">
              I entered the T&M seminar hoping to understand how I could combine these two interests. Throughout
              the semester, the seminar showed me that the intersection of business and technology is not only
              possible but incredibly valuable. Conversations with peers, guest speakers, and exposure to diverse
              perspectives helped me see how important it is to be able to navigate both fields.
            </p>

            <p className="text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed text-sm mt-3">
              One experience that stood out involved a speaker from Boeing. I had the opportunity to hear her speak
              to the group and to speak with her individually afterward. She began her career with a technical degree
              but later gained experience in business and management roles. Today, she holds a vice president position...
            </p>

            <p className="text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed text-sm mt-3">
              She explained how her technical background helped her communicate effectively with engineers, while her
              business experience prepared her to manage projects and people. Her story showed me that leadership roles
              in technology-driven companies are not limited to those who remain on a single track...
            </p>

            <p className="text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed text-sm mt-3">
              Another meaningful moment from the seminar came from something much more informal, the lunches. On one
              occasion, a scheduled speaker was unable to attend, and instead we were encouraged to talk with one another...
            </p>

            <p className="text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed text-sm mt-3">
              Before entering the program, I did not fully understand how business and technology worked together,
              even though both of my parents operate at this intersection. Through the seminar, I gained insight into
              how deeply intertwined these fields must be to succeed...
            </p>

            <p className="text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed text-sm mt-3">
              As I move forward, I feel more confident in the path I am building. What once felt like two separate
              interests has become a clear, unified direction. The seminar showed me that the intersection of business
              and technology is not something to choose between, but something to embrace...
